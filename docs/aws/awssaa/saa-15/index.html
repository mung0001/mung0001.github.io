      <h4 id="answer-c">Answer: C</h4>
<p>Explanation
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/">https://aws.amazon.com/global-accelerator/faqs/</a>
Register endpoints for endpoint groups: You register one or more regional resources, such as
Application Load Balancers, Network Load Balancers, EC2 Instances, or Elastic IP addresses, in each
endpoint group. Then you can set weights to choose how much traffic is routed to each endpoint.
Endpoints in AWS Global Accelerator
Endpoints in AWS Global Accelerator can be Network Load Balancers, Application Load Balancers,
Amazon EC2 instances, or Elastic IP addresses. A static IP address serves as a single point of contact
for clients, and Global Accelerator then distributes incoming traffic across healthy endpoints. Global
Accelerator directs traffic to endpoints by using the port (or port range) that you specify for the
listener that the endpoint group for the endpoint belongs to.
Each endpoint group can have multiple endpoints. You can add each endpoint to multiple endpoint
groups, but the endpoint groups must be associated with different listeners.
Global Accelerator continually monitors the health of all endpoints that are included in an endpoint
group. It routes traffic only to the active endpoints that are healthy. If Global Accelerator doesn&rsquo;t
have any healthy endpoints to route traffic to, it routes traffic to all endpoints.

      <h4 id="answer-b-e">Answer: B E</h4>
<p>Explanation
You can take advantage of the safety and reliability of geographic redundancy by spanning your Auto
Scaling group across multiple Availability Zones within a Region and then attaching a load balancer to
distribute incoming traffic across those zones. Incoming traffic is distributed equally across all
Availability Zones enabled for your load balancer.
Note
An Auto Scaling group can contain Amazon EC2 instances from multiple Availability Zones within the</p>
<p>81
same Region. However, an Auto Scaling group can&rsquo;t contain instances from multiple Regions.
When one Availability Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches
new instances in an unaffected zone. When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a healthy state,
Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling automatically redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the
zones for your Auto Scaling group. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does this by attempting to launch new
instances in the Availability Zone with the fewest instances. If the attempt fails, however, Amazon
EC2 Auto Scaling attempts to launch in other Availability Zones until it succeeds.
You can expand the availability of your scaled and load-balanced application by adding an Availability
Zone to your Auto Scaling group and then enabling that zone for your load balancer. After you&rsquo;ve
enabled the new Availability Zone, the load balancer begins to route traffic equally among all the
enabled zones.
High Availability (Multi-AZ) for Amazon RDS
Amazon RDS provides high availability and failover support for DB instances using Multi-AZ
deployments.
Amazon RDS uses several different technologies to provide failover support. Multi-AZ deployments
for MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL DB instances use Amazon&rsquo;s failover technology. SQL
Server DB instances use SQL Server Database Mirroring (DBM) or Always On Availability Groups
(AGs).
In a Multi-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous
standby replica in a different Availability Zone. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated
across Availability Zones to a standby replica to provide data redundancy, eliminate I/O freezes, and
minimize latency spikes during system backups. Running a DB instance with high availability can
enhance availability during planned system maintenance, and help protect your databases against DB
instance failure and Availability Zone disruption. For more information on Availability Zones, see
Regions, Availability Zones, and Local Zones

The solutions architect needs to find a cost-effective solution that will allow for the desired EC2 capacity to be reached quickly and allow the Auto Scaling group to scale down after the batch jobs are complete. <br>
What should the solutions architect do to meet these requirements?</p>
<p>A. Increase the minimum capacity for the Auto Scaling group.<br>
B. Increase the maximum capacity for the Auto Scaling group.<br>
C. Configure scheduled scaling to scale up to the desired compute level.<br>
D. Change the scaling policy to add more EC2 instances during each scaling operation.

<p>Explanation
Object Versioning
Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you
could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3
Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also
use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.
To customize your data retention approach and control storage costs, use object versioning with
Object lifecycle management. For information about creating S3 Lifecycle policies using the AWS
Management Console, see How Do I Create a Lifecycle Policy for an S3 Bucket?</p>
<p>in the Amazon Simple
Storage Service Console User Guide.
If you have an object expiration lifecycle policy in your non-versioned bucket and you want to
maintain the same permanent delete behavior when you enable versioning, you must add a
noncurrent expiration policy.
The noncurrent expiration lifecycle policy will manage the deletes of the noncurrent object versions</p>
<p>in the version-enabled bucket. (A version-enabled bucket maintains one current and zero or more
noncurrent object versions.) You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3
Versioning is disabled. Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your
bucket has a version ID. If you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version
ID to null. If S3 Versioning is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value
distinguishes it from other versions of the same key.
Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an
existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null),
contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object
that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same
key.
Only Amazon S3 generates version IDs, and they can&rsquo;t be edited. Version IDs are Unicode, UTF-8
encoded, URL-ready, opaque strings that are no more than 1,024 bytes long. The following is an
example:
3/L4kqtJlcpXroDTDmJ+rmSpXd3dIbrHY+MTRCxf3vjVBH40Nr8X8gdRQBpUMLUo.
Using MFA delete
If a bucket&rsquo;s versioning configuration is MFA Delete-enabled, the bucket owner must include the xamz-mfa request header in requests to permanently delete an object version or change the
versioning state of the bucket.
Requests that include x-amz-mfa must use HTTPS. The header&rsquo;s value is the concatenation of your
authentication device&rsquo;s serial number, a space, and the authentication code displayed on it. If you do
not include this request header, the request fails.

      <h4 id="answer-d">Answer: D</h4>
<p>Explanation
Scheduled Reserved Instances
Scheduled Reserved Instances (Scheduled Instances) enable you to purchase capacity reservations
that recur on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis, with a specified start time and duration, for a oneyear term. You reserve the capacity in advance, so that you know it is available when you need it. You
pay for the time that the instances are scheduled, even if you do not use them.
Scheduled Instances are a good choice for workloads that do not run continuously, but do run on a
regular schedule. For example, you can use Scheduled Instances for an application that runs during
business hours or for batch processing that runs at the end of the week.
If you require a capacity reservation on a continuous basis, Reserved Instances might meet your
needs and decrease costs.
How Scheduled Instances Work
Amazon EC2 sets aside pools of EC2 instances in each Availability Zone for use as Scheduled
Instances. Each pool supports a specific combination of instance type, operating system, and
network.
To get started, you must search for an available schedule. You can search across multiple pools or a
single pool. After you locate a suitable schedule, purchase it.
You must launch your Scheduled Instances during their scheduled time periods, using a launch
configuration that matches the following attributes of the schedule that you purchased: instance
type, Availability Zone, network, and platform. When you do so, Amazon EC2 launches EC2 instances
on your behalf, based on the specified launch specification. Amazon EC2 must ensure that the EC2
instances have terminated by the end of the current scheduled time period so that the capacity is
available for any other Scheduled Instances it is reserved for. Therefore, Amazon EC2 terminates the
EC2 instances three minutes before the end of the current scheduled time period.
You can&rsquo;t stop or reboot Scheduled Instances, but you can terminate them manually as needed. If you
terminate a Scheduled Instance before its current scheduled time period ends, you can launch it
again after a few minutes. Otherwise, you must wait until the next scheduled time period.
The following diagram illustrates the lifecycle of a Scheduled Instance.

<p>Explanation
Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Client Library (KCL) - Data from the data source can be continuously
captured and streamed in near real-time using Kinesis Data Streams.
With the Kinesis Client Library (KCL), you can build your own application that can preprocess the
streaming data as they arrive and emit the data for generating incremental views and downstream
analysis.
Kinesis Data Analytics - This service provides the easiest way to process the data that is streaming
through Kinesis Data Stream or Kinesis Data Firehose using SQL. This enables customers to gain
actionable insight in near real-time from the incremental stream before storing it in Amazon S3.</p>

<p>Explanation
VPC endpoints
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC
endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device,
VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP
addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other
service does not leave the Amazon network.
An interface endpoint is an elastic network interface with a private IP address from the IP address
range of your subnet that serves as an entry point for traffic destined to a supported service.
Interface endpoints are powered by AWS PrivateLink, a technology that enables you to privately
access services by using private IP addresses. AWS PrivateLink restricts all network traffic between
your VPC and services to the Amazon network. You do not need an internet gateway, a NAT device,
or a virtual private gateway.

    <div class="book-expand-content markdown-inner">
      <h4 id="answer-d">Answer: D</h4>
<p>Explanation
Reserved Instances
Having 50 EC2 RIs provide a discounted hourly rate and an optional capacity reservation for EC2
instances.
AWS Billing automatically applies your RI&rsquo;s discounted rate when attributes of EC2 instance usage
match attributes of an active RI.
If an Availability Zone is specified, EC2 reserves capacity matching the attributes of the RI. The
capacity reservation of an RI is automatically utilized by running instances matching these attributes.
You can also choose to forego the capacity reservation and purchase an RI that is scoped to a region.
RIs that are scoped to a region automatically apply the RI&rsquo;s discount to instance usage across AZs and
instance sizes in a region, making it easier for you to take advantage of the RI&rsquo;s discounted rate.
On-Demand Instance
On-Demand instances let you pay for compute capacity by the hour or second (minimum of 60
seconds) with no long-term commitments. This frees you from the costs and complexities of
planning, purchasing, and maintaining hardware and transforms what are commonly large fixed costs
into much smaller variable costs.
The pricing below includes the cost to run private and public AMIs on the specified operating system</p>
<p>100
(&ldquo;Windows Usage&rdquo; prices apply to Windows Server 2003 R2, 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and
2019). Amazon also provides you with additional instances for Amazon EC2 running Microsoft
Windows with SQL Server, Amazon EC2 running SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, Amazon EC2 running
Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Amazon EC2 running IBM that are priced differently.
Spot Instances
A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price.
Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts, you can
lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. The hourly price for a Spot Instance is called a Spot price.
The Spot price of each instance type in each Availability Zone is set by Amazon EC2, and adjusted
gradually based on the long-term supply of and demand for Spot Instances. Your Spot Instance runs
whenever capacity is available and the maximum price per hour for your request exceeds the Spot
price.

<p>Explanation
A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC
endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device,
VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. Instances in your VPC do not require public IP
addresses to communicate with resources in the service. Traffic between your VPC and the other
service does not leave the Amazon network.
Gateway endpoints
A gateway endpoint is a gateway that you specify as a target for a route in your route table for traffic
destined to a supported AWS service. The following AWS services are supported:
Amazon S3
DynamoDB

<p>Explanation
Regional Limitations for AWS Snowball
The AWS Snowball service has two device types, the standard Snowball and the Snowball Edge. The
following table highlights which of these devices are available in which regions.
Limitations on Jobs in AWS Snowball
The following limitations exist for creating jobs in AWS Snowball:
For security purposes, data transfers must be completed within 90 days of the Snowball being
prepared.
Currently, AWS Snowball Edge device doesn&rsquo;t support server-side encryption with customer-provided
keys (SSE-C). AWS Snowball Edge device does support server-side encryption with Amazon S3-
managed encryption keys (SSE-S3) and server-side encryption with AWS Key Management Servicemanaged keys (SSE-KMS). For more information, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption in
the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
In the US regions, Snowballs come in two sizes: 50 TB and 80 TB. All other regions have the 80 TB
Snowballs only. If you&rsquo;re using Snowball to import data, and you need to transfer more data than will
fit on a single Snowball, create additional jobs. Each export job can use multiple Snowballs.
The default service limit for the number of Snowballs you can have at one time is 1. If you want to
increase your service limit, contact AWS Support.
All objects transferred to the Snowball have their metadata changed. The only metadata that remains
the same is filename and filesize. All other metadata is set as in the following example: -rw-rw-r&ndash; 1
root root [filesize] Dec 31 1969 [path/filename] Object lifecycle management To manage your objects
so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle.
An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of
objects. There are two types of actions:
Transition actions-Define when objects transition to another storage class. For example, you might
choose to transition objects to the S3 Standard-IA storage class 30 days after you created them, or
archive objects to the S3 Glacier storage class one year after creating them.
Expiration actions-Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf.
The lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects.

provides file storage in the AWS Cloud. With Amazon EFS, you can create a file system, mount the file
system on an Amazon EC2 instance, and then read and write data to and from your file system. You
can mount an Amazon EFS file system in your VPC, through the Network File System versions 4.0 and
4.1 (NFSv4) protocol. We recommend using a current generation Linux NFSv4.1 client, such as those
found in the latest Amazon Linux, Redhat, and Ubuntu AMIs, in conjunction with the Amazon EFS
Mount Helper. For instructions, see Using the amazon-efs-utils Tools.
For a list of Amazon EC2 Linux Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that support this protocol, see NFS
Support. For some AMIs, you&rsquo;ll need to install an NFS client to mount your file system on your
Amazon EC2 instance. For instructions, see Installing the NFS Client.
You can access your Amazon EFS file system concurrently from multiple NFS clients, so applications
that scale beyond a single connection can access a file system. Amazon EC2 instances running in
multiple Availability Zones within the same AWS Region can access the file system, so that many
users can access and share a common data source.

see Limitations of Amazon RDS Encrypted DB Instances.
Open the Amazon RDS console, and then choose Snapshots from the navigation pane.
Select the snapshot that you want to encrypt.
Under Snapshot Actions, choose Copy Snapshot.
Choose your Destination Region, and then enter your New DB Snapshot Identifier.
Change Enable Encryption to Yes.
Select your Master Key from the list, and then choose Copy Snapshot.
After the snapshot status is available, the Encrypted field will be True to indicate that the snapshot is
encrypted.
You now have an encrypted snapshot of your DB. You can use this encrypted DB snapshot to restore
the DB instance from the DB snapshot.

<p>Explanation
Amazon Simple Queue Service
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a fully managed message queuing service that enables you to
decouple and scale microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications. SQS eliminates
the complexity and overhead associated with managing and operating message oriented middleware,
and empowers developers to focus on differentiating work. Using SQS, you can send, store, and
receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or
requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS console,
Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.
SQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort
ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are
processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.
Scaling Based on Amazon SQS
There are some scenarios where you might think about scaling in response to activity in an Amazon
SQS queue. For example, suppose that you have a web app that lets users upload images and use
them online. In this scenario, each image requires resizing and encoding before it can be published.
The app runs on EC2 instances in an Auto Scaling group, and it&rsquo;s configured to handle your typical
upload rates. Unhealthy instances are terminated and replaced to maintain current instance levels at
all times. The app places the raw bitmap data of the images in an SQS queue for processing. It
processes the images and then publishes the processed images where they can be viewed by users.
The architecture for this scenario works well if the number of image uploads doesn&rsquo;t vary over time.
But if the number of uploads changes over time, you might consider using dynamic scaling to scale
the capacity of your Auto Scaling group.

<p>Explanation
What Is Amazon CloudFront?</p>
<p>Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web
content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content
through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content
that you&rsquo;re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest
latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance Using Amazon
S3 Buckets for Your Origin When you use Amazon S3 as an origin for your distribution, you place any
objects that you want CloudFront to deliver in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can use any method that is
supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3, for example, the Amazon S3 console or
API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your bucket to store the objects, just as you
would with any other Amazon S3 bucket.
Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn&rsquo;t change the bucket in
any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and access Amazon S3 objects at the
standard Amazon S3 price. You incur regular Amazon S3 charges for storing the objects in the bucket.

<p>A company is building a document storage application on AWS. The Application runs on
Amazon EC2 instances in multiple Availability Zones. The company requires the document store to be
highly available. The documents need to be returned immediately when requested. The lead
engineer has configured the application to use Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS) to store the
documents, but is willing to consider other options to meet the availability requirement.
What should a solution architect recommend?</p>
<p>A. Snapshot the EBS volumes regularly and build new volumes using those snapshots in additional
Availability Zones. <br>
B. Use Amazon EBS for the EC2 instance root volumes. Configure the application to build the
document store on Amazon S3. <br>

<p>Explanation
Placement groups
When you launch a new EC2 instance, the EC2 service attempts to place the instance in such a way
that all of your instances are spread out across underlying hardware to minimize correlated failures.
You can use placement groups to influence the placement of a group of interdependent instances to
meet the needs of your workload. Depending on the type of workload.
Cluster - packs instances close together inside an Availability Zone. This strategy enables workloads to
achieve the low-latency network performance necessary for tightly-coupled node-to-node
communication that is typical of HPC applications.

request. Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) is an object storage service that offers industryleading scalability, data availability, security, and performance. This means customers of all sizes and
industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as
websites, mobile applications, backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, IoT devices, and
big data analytics. Amazon S3 provides easy-to-use management features so you can organize your
data and configure finely-tuned access controls to meet your specific business, organizational, and
compliance requirements. Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9&rsquo;s) of durability, and
stores data for millions of applications for companies all around the world.

<p>Explanation
Amazon RDS Read Replicas Now Support Multi-AZ Deployments
Starting today, Amazon RDS Read Replicas for MySQL and MariaDB now support Multi-AZ
deployments.
Combining Read Replicas with Multi-AZ enables you to build a resilient disaster recovery strategy and
simplify your database engine upgrade process.
Amazon RDS Read Replicas enable you to create one or more read-only copies of your database
instance within the same AWS Region or in a different AWS Region. Updates made to the source
database are then asynchronously copied to your Read Replicas. In addition to providing scalability
for read-heavy workloads, Read Replicas can be promoted to become a standalone database instance
when needed.
Amazon RDS Multi-AZ deployments provide enhanced availability for database instances within a
single AWS Region. With Multi-AZ, your data is synchronously replicated to a standby in a different
Availability Zone (AZ). In the event of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic
failover to the standby, minimizing disruption to your applications.
You can now use Read Replicas with Multi-AZ as part of a disaster recovery (DR) strategy for your
production databases. A well-designed and tested DR plan is critical for maintaining business
continuity after a disaster. A Read Replica in a different region than the source database can be used
as a standby database and promoted to become the new production database in case of a regional
disruption.
You can also combine Read Replicas with Multi-AZ for your database engine upgrade process. You
can create a Read Replica of your production database instance and upgrade it to a new database
engine version. When the upgrade is complete, you can stop applications, promote the Read Replica
to a standalone database instance, and switch over your applications. Since the database instance is
already a Multi-AZ deployment, no additional steps are needed.
Overview of Amazon RDS Read Replicas
Deploying one or more read replicas for a given source DB instance might make sense in a variety of
scenarios, including the following:
Scaling beyond the compute or I/O capacity of a single DB instance for read-heavy database
workloads. You can direct this excess read traffic to one or more read replicas.
Serving read traffic while the source DB instance is unavailable. In some cases, your source DB
instance might not be able to take I/O requests, for example due to I/O suspension for backups or
scheduled maintenance. In these cases, you can direct read traffic to your read replicas. For this use
case, keep in mind that the data on the read replica might be &ldquo;stale&rdquo; because the source DB instance
is unavailable.
Business reporting or data warehousing scenarios where you might want business reporting queries
to run against a read replica, rather than your primary, production DB instance.
Implementing disaster recovery. You can promote a read replica to a standalone instance as a
disaster recovery solution if the source DB instance fails.

<p>Explanation
Working with cross-site scripting match conditions
Attackers sometimes insert scripts into web requests in an effort to exploit vulnerabilities in web
applications.
You can create one or more cross-site scripting match conditions to identify the parts of web
requests, such as the URI or the query string, that you want AWS WAF Classic to inspect for possible
malicious scripts. Later in the process, when you create a web ACL, you specify whether to allow or
block requests that appear to contain malicious scripts.
Web Application Firewall
You can now use AWS WAF to protect your web applications on your Application Load Balancers.
AWS WAF is a web application firewall that helps protect your web applications from common web
exploits that could affect application availability, compromise security, or consume excessive
resources.

<p>A company is performing an AWS Well-Architected Framework review of an existing workload
deployed on AWS. The review identified a public-facing website running on the same Amazon EC2
instance as a Microsoft Active Directory domain controller that was install recently to support other
AWS services. A solutions architect needs to recommend a new design that would improve the
security of the architecture and minimize the administrative demand on IT staff.
What should the solutions architect recommend?</p>
<p>A. Use AWS Directory Service to create a managed Active Directory. Uninstall Active Directory on the
current EC2 instance.<br>
B. Create another EC2 instance in the same subnet and reinstall Active Directory on it. Uninstall
Active Directory.<br>
C. Use AWS Directory Service to create an Active Directory connector. Proxy Active Directory
requests to the Active domain controller running on the current EC2 instance.<br>
D. Enable AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) with Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML) 2.0
federation with the current Active Directory controller. Modify the EC2 instance&rsquo;s security group to
deny public access to Active Directory.

<p>Explanation
AWS Managed Microsoft AD
AWS Directory Service lets you run Microsoft Active Directory (AD) as a managed service. AWS
Directory Service for Microsoft Active Directory, also referred to as AWS Managed Microsoft AD, is
powered by Windows Server 2012 R2. When you select and launch this directory type, it is created as
a highly available pair of domain controllers connected to your virtual private cloud (VPC). The
domain controllers run in different Availability Zones in a region of your choice. Host monitoring and
recovery, data replication, snapshots, and software updates are automatically configured and
managed for you.

Your Scaled and Load-Balanced Application to an Additional Availability Zone When one Availability
Zone becomes unhealthy or unavailable, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling launches new instances in an
unaffected zone. When the unhealthy Availability Zone returns to a healthy state, Amazon EC2 Auto
Scaling automatically redistributes the application instances evenly across all of the zones for your
Auto Scaling group. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling does this by attempting to launch new instances in the
Availability Zone with the fewest instances. If the attempt fails, however, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
attempts to launch in other Availability Zones until it succeeds.
You can expand the availability of your scaled and load-balanced application by adding an Availability
Zone to your Auto Scaling group and then enabling that zone for your load balancer. After you&rsquo;ve
enabled the new Availability Zone, the load balancer begins to route traffic equally among all the
enabled zones.

<p>Explanation
Data can be recover if versioning enable, also it provide a extra protection like file delete,MFA delete.
MFA Delete only works for CLI or API interaction, not in the AWS Management Console. Also, you
cannot make version DELETE actions with MFA using IAM user credentials. You must use your root
AWS account.
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3/">https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/securing-access-to-aws-using-mfa-part-3/</a> Object Versioning
Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you
could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3
Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also
use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.
You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled.
Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If
you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning
is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other
versions of the same key.

<p>Explanation
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_policies_scp.html</a>.
Service Control Policy concepts
SCPs offer central access controls for all IAM entities in your accounts. You can use them to enforce
the permissions you want everyone in your business to follow. Using SCPs, you can give your
developers more freedom to manage their own permissions because you know they can only operate
within the boundaries you define.
You create and apply SCPs through AWS Organizations. When you create an organization, AWS
Organizations automatically creates a root, which forms the parent container for all the accounts in
your organization. Inside the root, you can group accounts in your organization into organizational
units (OUs) to simplify management of these accounts. You can create multiple OUs within a single
organization, and you can create OUs within other OUs to form a hierarchical structure. You can
attach SCPs to the organization root, OUs, and individual accounts. SCPs attached to the root and
OUs apply to all OUs and accounts inside of them.
SCPs use the AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policy language; however, they do not
grant permissions. SCPs enable you set permission guardrails by defining the maximum available
permissions for IAM entities in an account. If a SCP denies an action for an account, none of the
entities in the account can take that action, even if their IAM permissions allow them to do so. The
guardrails set in SCPs apply to all IAM entities in the account, which include all users, roles, and the
account root user.

Explanation
Amazon SQS Introduces FIFO Queues with Exactly-Once Processing and Lower Prices for Standard
Queues You can now use Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) for applications that require messages
to be processed in a strict sequence and exactly once using First-in, First-out (FIFO) queues. FIFO
queues are designed to ensure that the order in which messages are sent and received is strictly
preserved and that each message is processed exactly once.
Amazon SQS is a reliable and highly-scalable managed message queue service for storing messages in
transit between application components. FIFO queues complement the existing Amazon SQS
standard queues, which offer high throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. FIFO
queues have essentially the same features as standard queues, but provide the added benefits of
supporting ordering and exactly-once processing. FIFO queues provide additional features that help
prevent unintentional duplicates from being sent by message producers or from being received by
message consumers. Additionally, message groups allow multiple separate ordered message streams
within the same queue.

<p>Explanation
AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers.
AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests
per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no
charge when your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of
application or backend service - all with zero administration. AWS Lambda runs your code on a high
-availability compute infrastructure and performs all of the administration of the compute resources,
including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic scaling,
code monitoring and logging. All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS
Lambda supports.
Storing your static content with S3 provides a lot of advantages. But to help optimize your
application&rsquo;s performance and security while effectively managing cost, we recommend that you also
set up Amazon CloudFront to work with your S3 bucket to serve and protect the content. CloudFront
is a content delivery network (CDN) service that delivers static and dynamic web content, video
streams, and APIs around the world, securely and at scale. By design, delivering data out of
CloudFront can be more cost effective than delivering it from S3 directly to your users.
CloudFront serves content through a worldwide network of data centers called Edge Locations. Using
edge servers to cache and serve content improves performance by providing content closer to where
viewers are located. CloudFront has edge servers in locations all around the world

<h4 id="question-185"><strong>QUESTION</strong></h4>
<p>A company has an application that posts messages to Amazon SQS Another application polls
the queue and processes the messages in an l/O-intensive operation The company has a service level
agreement (SLA) that specifies the maximum amount of time that can elapse between receiving the
messages and responding to the users Due to an increase in the number of messages the company
has difficulty meeting its SLA consistently.
What should a solutions architect do to help improve the application&rsquo;s processing time and ensure it
can handle the load at any level?</p>
<p>A. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the instance used for processing Terminate the
instance and replace it with a larger size. <br>
B. Create an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the instance used for processing Terminate the
instance and replace it with an Amazon EC2 Dedicated Instance <br>

<p>Explanation
Scheduled Scaling for Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
Scheduled scaling allows you to set your own scaling schedule. For example, let&rsquo;s say that every week
the traffic to your web application starts to increase on Wednesday, remains high on Thursday, and
starts to decrease on Friday. You can plan your scaling actions based on the predictable traffic
patterns of your web application. Scaling actions are performed automatically as a function of time
and date.

<p>Explanation
S3 Intelligent-Tiering
S3 Intelligent-Tiering is a new Amazon S3 storage class designed for customers who want to optimize
storage costs automatically when data access patterns change, without performance impact or
operational overhead. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the first cloud object storage class that delivers
automatic cost savings by moving data between two access tiers - frequent access and infrequent
access - when access patterns change, and is ideal for data with unknown or changing access patterns
.
S3 Intelligent-Tiering stores objects in two access tiers: one tier that is optimized for frequent access
and another lower-cost tier that is optimized for infrequent access. For a small monthly monitoring
and automation fee per object, S3 Intelligent-Tiering monitors access patterns and moves objects
that have not been accessed for 30 consecutive days to the infrequent access tier. There are no
retrieval fees in S3 Intelligent-Tiering. If an object in the infrequent access tier is accessed later, it is
automatically moved back to the frequent access tier.
No additional tiering fees apply when objects are moved between access tiers within the S3
Intelligent-Tiering storage class. S3 Intelligent-Tiering is designed for 99.9% availability and
99.999999999% durability, and offers the same low latency and high throughput performance of S3
Standard.

<p>Explanation
AWS Lambda
With Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type of application or backend service - all with zero
administration. Just upload your code and Lambda takes care of everything required to run and scale
your code with high availability. You can set up your code to automatically trigger from other AWS
services or call it directly from any web or mobile app.
Amazon API Gateway
Amazon API Gateway is a fully managed service that makes it easy for developers to create, publish,
maintain, monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. APIs act as the &ldquo;front door&rdquo; for applications to access
data, business logic, or functionality from your backend services. Using API Gateway, you can create
RESTful APIs and WebSocket APIs that enable real-time two-way communication applications. API
Gateway supports containerized and serverless workloads, as well as web applications.
API Gateway handles all the tasks involved in accepting and processing up to hundreds of thousands
of concurrent API calls, including traffic management, CORS support, authorization and access
control, throttling, monitoring, and API version management. API Gateway has no minimum fees or
startup costs. You pay for the API calls you receive and the amount of data transferred out and, with
the API Gateway tiered pricing model, you can reduce your cost as your API usage scales.

<p>Explanation
Cross Region EC2 AMI Copy
We know that you want to build applications that span AWS Regions and we&rsquo;re working to provide
you with the services and features needed to do so. We started out by launching the EBS Snapshot
Copy feature late last year. This feature gave you the ability to copy a snapshot from Region to
Region with just a couple of clicks.
In addition, last month we made a significant reduction (26% to 83%) in the cost of transferring data
between AWS Regions, making it less expensive to operate in more than one AWS region.
Today we are introducing a new feature: Amazon Machine Image (AMI) Copy. AMI Copy enables you
to easily copy your Amazon Machine Images between AWS Regions. AMI Copy helps enable several
key scenarios including:
Simple and Consistent Multi-Region Deployment - You can copy an AMI from one region to another,
enabling you to easily launch consistent instances based on the same AMI into different regions.
Scalability - You can more easily design and build world-scale applications that meet the needs of your
users, regardless of their location.
Performance - You can increase performance by distributing your application and locating critical
components of your application in closer proximity to your users. You can also take advantage of
region-specific features such as instance types or other AWS services.
Even Higher Availability - You can design and deploy applications across AWS regions, to increase
availability.
Once the new AMI is in an Available state the copy is complete.

<p>Explanation
Share an object with others
All objects by default are private. Only the object owner has permission to access these objects.
However, the object owner can optionally share objects with others by creating a presigned URL,
using their own security credentials, to grant time-limited permission to download the objects.
When you create a presigned URL for your object, you must provide your security credentials, specify
a bucket name, an object key, specify the HTTP method (GET to download the object) and expiration
date and time. The presigned URLs are valid only for the specified duration.
Anyone who receives the presigned URL can then access the object. For example, if you have a video
in your bucket and both the bucket and the object are private, you can share the video with others by
generating a presigned URL.

    <div class="book-expand-content markdown-inner">
      <h4 id="answer-a">Answer: A</h4>
<p>Explanation
What Is Amazon CloudFront?</p>
<p>Amazon CloudFront is a web service that speeds up distribution of your static and dynamic web
content, such as .html, .css, .js, and image files, to your users. CloudFront delivers your content
through a worldwide network of data centers called edge locations. When a user requests content
that you&rsquo;re serving with CloudFront, the user is routed to the edge location that provides the lowest
latency (time delay), so that content is delivered with the best possible performance.
If the content is already in the edge location with the lowest latency, CloudFront delivers it
immediately.
If the content is not in that edge location, CloudFront retrieves it from an origin that you&rsquo;ve definedsuch as an Amazon S3 bucket, a MediaPackage channel, or an HTTP server (for example, a web
server) that you have identified as the source for the definitive version of your content.
As an example, suppose that you&rsquo;re
serving an image from a traditional web server, not from CloudFront. For example, you might serve
an image, sunsetphoto.png, using the URL <a href="http://example.com/sunsetphoto.png">http://example.com/sunsetphoto.png</a>.
Your users can easily navigate to this URL and see the image. But they probably don&rsquo;t know that their
request was routed from one network to another-through the complex collection of interconnected
networks that comprise the internet-until the image was found.
CloudFront speeds up the distribution of your content by routing each user request through the AWS
backbone network to the edge location that can best serve your content. Typically, this is a
CloudFront edge server that provides the fastest delivery to the viewer. Using the AWS network
dramatically reduces the number of networks that your users&rsquo; requests must pass through, which
improves performance. Users get lower latency-the time it takes to load the first byte of the file-and
higher data transfer rates.
You also get increased reliability and availability because copies of your files (also known as objects)
are now held (or cached) in multiple edge locations around the world.

<p>Explanation
Amazon FSx for Lustre
Amazon FSx for Lustre is a new, fully managed service provided by AWS based on the Lustre file
system.
Amazon FSx for Lustre provides a high-performance file system optimized for fast processing of
workloads such as machine learning, high performance computing (HPC), video processing, financial
modeling, and electronic design automation (EDA).
FSx for Lustre allows customers to create a Lustre filesystem on demand and associate it to an
Amazon S3 bucket. As part of the filesystem creation, Lustre reads the objects in the buckets and
adds that to the file system metadata. Any Lustre client in your VPC is then able to access the data,
which gets cached on the high-speed Lustre filesystem. This is ideal for HPC workloads, because you
can get the speed of an optimized Lustre file system without having to manage the complexity of
deploying, optimizing, and managing the Lustre cluster.
Additionally, having the filesystem work natively with Amazon S3 means you can shut down the
Lustre filesystem when you don&rsquo;t need it but still access objects in Amazon S3 via other AWS Services.
FSx for Lustre also allows you to also write the output of your HPC job back to Amazon S3.

      <h4 id="answer-c">Answer: C</h4>
<p>Explanation
How Amazon EFS Works with Amazon EC2
The following illustration shows an example VPC accessing an Amazon EFS file system. Here, EC2
instances in the VPC have file systems mounted.
In this illustration, the VPC has three Availability Zones, and each has one mount target created in it.
We recommend that you access the file system from a mount target within the same Availability
Zone. One of the Availability Zones has two subnets. However, a mount target is created in only one
of the subnets.
Benefits of Auto Scaling
Better fault tolerance. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can detect when an instance is unhealthy, terminate
it, and launch an instance to replace it. You can also configure Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling to use
multiple Availability Zones. If one Availability Zone becomes unavailable, Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling
can launch instances in another one to compensate.
Better availability. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling helps ensure that your application always has the right
amount of capacity to handle the current traffic demand.
Better cost management. Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling can dynamically increase and decrease capacity
as needed. Because you pay for the EC2 instances you use, you save money by launching instances
when they are needed and terminating them when they aren&rsquo;t.

<p>Explanation
However, because you can encrypt a copy of an unencrypted DB snapshot, you can effectively add
encryption to an unencrypted DB instance. That is, you can create a snapshot of your DB instance,
and then create an encrypted copy of that snapshot. You can then restore a DB instance from the
encrypted snapshot, and thus you have an encrypted copy of your original DB instance DB instances
that are encrypted can&rsquo;t be modified to disable encryption.
You can&rsquo;t have an encrypted read replica of an unencrypted DB instance or an unencrypted read
replica of an encrypted DB instance.
Encrypted read replicas must be encrypted with the same key as the source DB instance when both
are in the same AWS Region.
You can&rsquo;t restore an unencrypted backup or snapshot to an encrypted DB instance.
To copy an encrypted snapshot from one AWS Region to another, you must specify the KMS key
identifier of the destination AWS Region. This is because KMS encryption keys are specific to the AWS
Region that they are created in.

    <div class="book-expand-content markdown-inner">
      <h4 id="answer-b">Answer: B</h4>
<p>Explanation
Active-passive failover
Use an active-passive failover configuration when you want a primary resource or group of resources
to be available the majority of the time and you want a secondary resource or group of resources to
be on standby in case all the primary resources become unavailable. When responding to queries,
Route 53 includes only the healthy primary resources. If all the primary resources are unhealthy,
Route 53 begins to include only the healthy secondary resources in response to DNS queries.
To create an active-passive failover configuration with one primary record and one secondary record,
you just create the records and specify Failover for the routing policy. When the primary resource is
healthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the primary record. When the primary resource is
unhealthy, Route 53 responds to DNS queries using the secondary record.
How Amazon Route 53 averts cascading failures
As a first defense against cascading failures, each request routing algorithm (such as weighted and
failover) has a mode of last resort. In this special mode, when all records are considered unhealthy,
the Route 53 algorithm reverts to considering all records healthy.
For example, if all instances of an application, on several hosts, are rejecting health check requests,
Route 53 DNS servers will choose an answer anyway and return it rather than returning no DNS
answer or returning an NXDOMAIN (non-existent domain) response. An application can respond to
users but still fail health checks, so this provides some protection against misconfiguration.
Similarly, if an application is overloaded, and one out of three endpoints fails its health checks, so
that it&rsquo;s excluded from Route 53 DNS responses, Route 53 distributes responses between the two
remaining endpoints.
If the remaining endpoints are unable to handle the additional load and they fail, Route 53 reverts to
distributing requests to all three endpoints.

<p>Explanation
AWS Global Accelerator
Acceleration for latency-sensitive applications
Many applications, especially in areas such as gaming, media, mobile apps, and financials, require
very low latency for a great user experience. To improve the user experience, Global Accelerator
directs user traffic to the application endpoint that is nearest to the client, which reduces internet
latency and jitter. Global Accelerator routes traffic to the closest edge location by using Anycast, and
then routes it to the closest regional endpoint over the AWS global network. Global Accelerator
quickly reacts to changes in network performance to improve your users&rsquo; application performance.
Amazon CloudFront
Amazon CloudFront is a fast content delivery network (CDN) service that securely delivers data,
videos, applications, and APIs to customers globally with low latency, high transfer speeds, all within
a developer-friendly environment.

<p>Explanation
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html">https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ReadRepl.html</a> Amazon RDS
uses the MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server DB engines&rsquo; built-in
replication functionality to create a special type of DB instance called a read replica from a source DB
instance. Updates made to the source DB instance are asynchronously copied to the read replica. You
can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications to the
read replica.
When you create a read replica, you first specify an existing DB instance as the source. Then Amazon
RDS takes a snapshot of the source instance and creates a read-only instance from the snapshot.
Amazon RDS then uses the asynchronous replication method for the DB engine to update the read
replica whenever there is a change to the source DB instance. The read replica operates as a DB
instance that allows only read-only connections. Applications connect to a read replica the same way
they do to any DB instance. Amazon RDS replicates all databases in the source DB instance.

AWS Storage Gateway Hardware Appliance</p>
<p>Hardware Appliance
Storage Gateway is available as a hardware appliance, adding to the existing support for VMware
ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Amazon EC2. This means that you can now make use of Storage
Gateway in situations where you do not have a virtualized environment, server-class hardware or IT
staff with the specialized skills that are needed to manage them. You can order appliances from
Amazon.com for delivery to branch offices, warehouses, and &ldquo;outpost&rdquo; offices that lack dedicated IT
resources. Setup (as you will see in a minute) is quick and easy, and gives you access to three storage
solutions:
File Gateway - A file interface to Amazon S3, accessible via NFS or SMB. The files are stored as S3
objects, allowing you to make use of specialized S3 features such as lifecycle management and crossregion replication. You can trigger AWS Lambda functions, run Amazon Athena queries, and use
Amazon Macie to discover and classify sensitive data.

<p>Explanation
Using Amazon S3 Origins, MediaPackage Channels, and Custom Origins for Web Distributions Using
Amazon S3 Buckets for Your Origin When you use Amazon S3 as an origin for your distribution, you
place any objects that you want CloudFront to deliver in an Amazon S3 bucket. You can use any
method that is supported by Amazon S3 to get your objects into Amazon S3, for example, the
Amazon S3 console or API, or a third-party tool. You can create a hierarchy in your bucket to store
the objects, just as you would with any other Amazon S3 bucket.
Using an existing Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn&rsquo;t change the bucket in
any way; you can still use it as you normally would to store and access Amazon S3 objects at the
standard Amazon S3 price. You incur regular Amazon S3 charges for storing the objects in the bucket.
Using Amazon S3 Buckets Configured as Website Endpoints for Your Origin You can set up an Amazon
S3 bucket that is configured as a website endpoint as custom origin with CloudFront.
When you configure your CloudFront distribution, for the origin, enter the Amazon S3 static website
hosting endpoint for your bucket. This value appears in the Amazon S3 console, on the Properties
tab, in the Static website hosting pane. For example:
<a href="http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com">http://bucket-name.s3-website-region.amazonaws.com</a>
For more information about specifying Amazon S3 static website endpoints, see Website endpoints in
the Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide.
When you specify the bucket name in this format as your origin, you can use Amazon S3 redirects
and Amazon S3 custom error documents. For more information about Amazon S3 features, see the
Amazon S3 documentation.
Using an Amazon S3 bucket as your CloudFront origin server doesn&rsquo;t change it in any way. You can
still use it as you normally would and you incur regular Amazon S3 charges.</p>

Amazon Elastic File System
Amazon Elastic File System (Amazon EFS) provides a simple, scalable, fully managed elastic NFS file
system for use with AWS Cloud services and on-premises resources. It is built to scale on demand to
petabytes without disrupting applications, growing and shrinking automatically as you add and
remove files, eliminating the need to provision and manage capacity to accommodate growth.
Amazon EFS is designed to provide massively parallel shared access to thousands of Amazon EC2
instances, enabling your applications to achieve high levels of aggregate throughput and IOPS with
consistent low latencies.
Amazon EFS is well suited to support a broad spectrum of use cases from home directories to
business-critical applications. Customers can use EFS to lift-and-shift existing enterprise applications
to the AWS Cloud. Other use cases include: big data analytics, web serving and content management,
application development and testing, media and entertainment workflows, database backups, and
container storage.
Amazon EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for
high availability and durability. Amazon EC2 instances can access your file system across AZs, regions,
and VPCs, while on-premises servers can access using AWS Direct Connect or AWS VPN.

<p>Explanation
Amazon RDS Read Replicas
Amazon RDS Read Replicas provide enhanced performance and durability for RDS database (DB)
instances.
They make it easy to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of a single DB instance for
read-heavy database workloads. You can create one or more replicas of a given source DB Instance
and serve high-volume application read traffic from multiple copies of your data, thereby increasing
aggregate read throughput. Read replicas can also be promoted when needed to become standalone
DB instances. Read replicas are available in Amazon RDS for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle,
and SQL Server as well as Amazon Aurora.
For the MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server database engines, Amazon RDS creates
a second DB instance using a snapshot of the source DB instance. It then uses the engines&rsquo; native
asynchronous replication to update the read replica whenever there is a change to the source DB
instance. The read replica operates as a DB instance that allows only read-only connections;
applications can connect to a read replica just as they would to any DB instance. Amazon RDS
replicates all databases in the source DB instance.
Amazon Aurora futher extends the benefits of read replicas by employing an SSD-backed virtualized
storage layer purpose-built for database workloads. Amazon Aurora replicas share the same
underlying storage as the source instance, lowering costs and avoiding the need to copy data to the
replica nodes. For more information about replication with Amazon Aurora, see the online
documentation.</p>

<p>Explanation
Object Versioning
Use Amazon S3 Versioning to keep multiple versions of an object in one bucket. For example, you
could store my-image.jpg (version 111111) and my-image.jpg (version 222222) in a single bucket. S3
Versioning protects you from the consequences of unintended overwrites and deletions. You can also
use it to archive objects so that you have access to previous versions.
You must explicitly enable S3 Versioning on your bucket. By default, S3 Versioning is disabled.
Regardless of whether you have enabled Versioning, each object in your bucket has a version ID. If
you have not enabled Versioning, Amazon S3 sets the value of the version ID to null. If S3 Versioning
is enabled, Amazon S3 assigns a version ID value for the object. This value distinguishes it from other
versions of the same key.
Enabling and suspending versioning is done at the bucket level. When you enable versioning on an
existing bucket, objects that are already stored in the bucket are unchanged. The version IDs (null),
contents, and permissions remain the same. After you enable S3 Versioning for a bucket, each object
that is added to the bucket gets a version ID, which distinguishes it from other versions of the same
key.
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)
Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) defines a way for client web applications that are loaded in one
domain to interact with resources in a different domain. With CORS support, you can build rich clientside web applications with Amazon S3 and selectively allow cross-origin access to your Amazon S3
resources.

<p>Explanation
Network Load Balancer overview
A Network Load Balancer functions at the fourth layer of the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI)
model. It can handle millions of requests per second. After the load balancer receives a connection
request, it selects a target from the target group for the default rule. It attempts to open a TCP
connection to the selected target on the port specified in the listener configuration.
When you enable an Availability Zone for the load balancer, Elastic Load Balancing creates a load
balancer node in the Availability Zone. By default, each load balancer node distributes traffic across
the registered targets in its Availability Zone only. If you enable cross-zone load balancing, each load
balancer node distributes traffic across the registered targets in all enabled Availability Zones. For
more information, see Availability Zones.
If you enable multiple Availability Zones for your load balancer and ensure that each target group has
at least one target in each enabled Availability Zone, this increases the fault tolerance of your
applications. For example, if one or more target groups does not have a healthy target in an
Availability Zone, we remove the IP address for the corresponding subnet from DNS, but the load
balancer nodes in the other Availability Zones are still available to route traffic. If a client doesn&rsquo;t
honor the time-to-live (TTL) and sends requests to the IP address after it is removed from DNS, the
requests fail.
For TCP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol,
source IP address, source port, destination IP address, destination port, and TCP sequence number.
The TCP connections from a client have different source ports and sequence numbers, and can be
routed to different targets. Each individual TCP connection is routed to a single target for the life of
the connection.
For UDP traffic, the load balancer selects a target using a flow hash algorithm based on the protocol,
source IP address, source port, destination IP address, and destination port. A UDP flow has the same
source and destination, so it is consistently routed to a single target throughout its lifetime. Different
UDP flows have different source IP addresses and ports, so they can be routed to different targets.
An Auto Scaling group contains a collection of Amazon EC2 instances that are treated as a logical
grouping for the purposes of automatic scaling and management. An Auto Scaling group also enables
you to use Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling features such as health check replacements and scaling policies.
Both maintaining the number of instances in an Auto Scaling group and automatic scaling are the
core functionality of the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service.
The size of an Auto Scaling group depends on the number of instances that you set as the desired
capacity.
You can adjust its size to meet demand, either manually or by using automatic scaling.
An Auto Scaling group starts by launching enough instances to meet its desired capacity. It maintains
this number of instances by performing periodic health checks on the instances in the group. The
Auto Scaling group continues to maintain a fixed number of instances even if an instance becomes
unhealthy. If an instance becomes unhealthy, the group terminates the unhealthy instance and
launches another instance to replace it.

&ldquo;Server-Side Encryption with Customer Master Keys (CMKs) Stored in AWS Key Management Service
(SSE-KMS) is similar to SSE-S3, but with some additional benefits and charges for using this service.
There are separate permissions for the use of a CMK that provides added protection against
unauthorized access of your objects in Amazon S3. SSE-KMS also provides you with an audit trail that
shows when your CMK was used and by whom.&rdquo; Server-Side Encryption: Using SSE-KMS You can
protect data at rest in Amazon S3 by using three different modes of server-side encryption: SSE-S3,
SSE-C, or SSE-KMS.
SSE-S3 requires that Amazon S3 manage the data and master encryption keys. For more information
about SSE-S3, see Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with Amazon S3-Managed Encryption
Keys (SSE-S3).
SSE-C requires that you manage the encryption key. For more information about SSE-C, see
Protecting Data Using Server-Side Encryption with Customer-Provided Encryption Keys (SSE-C).
SSE-KMS requires that AWS manage the data key but you manage the customer master key (CMK) in
AWS KMS.
The remainder of this topic discusses how to protect data by using server-side encryption with AWS
KMS-managed keys (SSE-KMS).
You can request encryption and select a CMK by using the Amazon S3 console or API. In the console,
check the appropriate box to perform encryption and select your CMK from the list. For the Amazon
S3 API, specify encryption and choose your CMK by setting the appropriate headers in a GET or PUT
request.

<p>A company&rsquo;s website is using an Amazon RDS MySQL Multi-AZ DB instance for its
transactional data storage.
There are other internal systems that query this DB instance to fetch data for internal batch
processing. The RDS DB instance slows down significantly the internal systems fetch data. This
impacts the website&rsquo;s read and write performance, and the users experience slow response times.
Which solution will improve the website&rsquo;s performance?</p>
<p>A. Use an RDS PostgreSQL DB instance instead of a MySQL database. <br>
B. Use Amazon ElastiCache to cache the query responses for the website. <br>
C. Add an additional Availability Zone to the current RDS MySQL Multi.AZ DB instance. <br>
D. Add a read replica to the RDS DB instance and configure the internal systems to query the read
replica.

<p>Explanation
Amazon RDS Read Replicas
Enhanced performance
You can reduce the load on your source DB instance by routing read queries from your applications
to the read replica. Read replicas allow you to elastically scale out beyond the capacity constraints of
a single DB instance for read-heavy database workloads. Because read replicas can be promoted to
master status, they are useful as part of a sharding implementation.
To further maximize read performance, Amazon RDS for MySQL allows you to add table indexes
directly to Read Replicas, without those indexes being present on the master.
